                                   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

                                   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                                   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                                   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                                   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
                                          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
                                          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
                                          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
                                          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                                          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
                                          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                                          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                                          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
                                          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                                          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
                                          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
                                          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must

                                          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
                                          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
                                          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by

                                     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
                                     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
                                     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                                     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
                                     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
                                     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                                     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                                     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
                                     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
                                     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                                     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
                                     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                                     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
                                     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
                                     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                                     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                                     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
                                     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

                                     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
                                     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
                                     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
                                     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
                                     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                                     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
                                     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                                     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
                                     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
                                     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                                     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                                     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
                                     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
                                     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
                                     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                                     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                                     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                                     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                                     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                                     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
                                     terms You offer.

                                     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
                                     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
                                     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

                                     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                                     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
                                     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                                     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                                     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
                                     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
                                     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
                                     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                                     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
                                     understand it.

                                     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
                                     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
                                     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
                                     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
                                     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
                                     Covered Code created under this License.

                                     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by

                                     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
                                     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
